Just like arrays, hashes can also have multiple elements in them. 
So naturally, there will be times when you need to iterate over them. 
Youâ€™ll use the each method again to iterate over hashes. The syntax is similar to iterating over arrays, 
but instead of specifying a single variable to hold the index, you specify variables for both the key and the value

person_hash = {
    "name" => "Pavan",
    "age" => 30
}
person_hash.each do |key, value|
    puts "#{key} is #{value}"
   end
