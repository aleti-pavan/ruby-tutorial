You might have noticed that the programs you’ve written so far are very rigid. They produce the same result, don’t accept user input, and don’t change their behavior based on the environment. The variables and their values remain the same.

To make our programs more flexible, we use control flow. Control flow consists of keywords that enable us to select different outcomes depending on the input, the result of a computation or evaluation, or the value returned by some other function. We’ll go into details of each control flow keyword one-by-one.




__Logical Operators__

Ruby allows you to form more complex comparisons in if expressions using logical operators. The following table explains the logical operators offered by Ruby.

`&& (and)`

A condition using the && operator evaluates to true if both operands are true.

`|| (or)`

A condition using the || operator evaluates to true if any of the operands are true.

`! (not)`

The ! operator reverses the state of a single operand.
