You might have noticed that the programs you’ve written so far are very rigid. They produce the same result, don’t accept user input, and don’t change their behavior based on the environment. The variables and their values remain the same.

To make our programs more flexible, we use control flow. Control flow consists of keywords that enable us to select different outcomes depending on the input, the result of a computation or evaluation, or the value returned by some other function. We’ll go into details of each control flow keyword one-by-one.
