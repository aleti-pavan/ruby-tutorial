# Arithmetic Operations

=begin

The interesting thing to note here is that, 
since x was declared to be a float, the output will be a float as well. 
If you want to get integer output, then you should declare both variables as integers.

x = 5.0
y = 3

# addition
sum = x + y
puts "Sum of #{x} and #{y} is #{sum}"

# subtraction
sub = x - y
puts "Substraction of #{x} and #{y} is #{sum}"

# multiplication
mul = x * y
puts mul

# division
div = x / y
puts div

# mod
mod = x % y
puts mod
